# Homebrew cask for Craig's Claude Counter (macOS app).
#
# Distributed via a personal tap:
#   brew tap CraigVG/tap
#   brew install --cask craigs-claude-counter
#
# After notarizing a release, fill in `version` and `sha256` (the script prints
# the DMG's SHA-256), upload the DMG to the matching GitHub release, and copy
# this file into the tap repo (CraigVG/homebrew-tap) under Casks/.
#
# Note: the app reads usage from the local engine (the Node server in this repo).
# Run it with `npm start` / the LaunchAgent so the app + widget show live data.
